<p style="margin-left: 20%; font-weight: bold;"><a id="PRELUDE"></a>PRELUDE</p>
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 20%;">
I am a little tired of all things mortal;<br>
I see through half-shut eyelids languorous<br>
The old monotonous<br>
Gold sun set slowly through the western portal,<br>
Where I recline upon my deep dîwân,<br>
In Ispahân.<br>
<br>
I am a little weary of the Persian<br>
Girl that I lov'd; I am quite tir'd of love;<br>
And I am weary of<br>
The smoking censers, and the sweet diversion<br>
Of stroking Leila's jasmine-scented hair,<br>
I thought so fair.<br>
<br>
At last I think I am quite tired of beauty;<br>
Why do the stars shine always in the sky?<br>
I think if I might die,<br>
Something more sweet, less tiring than the duty<br>
Of kissing her, might be; I am tired of myrrh,<br>
And kissing her.<br>
<br>
Khaled, come, come, and slowly move the scented<br>
Gold narghilé away; let the lyres cease.<br>
And now a little peace!<br>
For see, moon-faced Leila hath repented<br>
Of singing Hafiz' songs melodiously,<br>
And languidly.<br>
<br>
Surely all things are vain, and great thanksgiving<br>
Is due not; surely all things now are vain;<br>
And all my heart is fain<br>
Of something, something, far too great for living;<br>
Nothing is very sad, nor wonderful,<br>
Nor beautiful.<br>
<br>
Well now, since all things are not worth the winning,<br>
Goodbye! With these I have a little play'd;<br>
And once, alas, I pray'd<br>
That gorgeous, golden sins be mine for sinning;<br>
But now I would not leave my palanquin<br>
For any sin.<br>
<br>
And long ago I prov'd in great compassion<br>
For man, that Brahm is not nor ever was;<br>
But now, alas, alas<br>
<br>
I would he were, that in the olden fashion<br>
I might laugh once again ere all is said;<br>
But Brahm is dead.<br>
<br>
Then with philosophy I bor'd me duly;<br>
And since I could not slumber all the time,<br>
I, in sweet golden rhyme,<br>
On white papyrus scented with patchouli<br>
Wrote masterpieces starry-beautiful.<br>
The earth was full.<br>
<br>
So beauty wearied me; in order slowly<br>
Love, Joy, and Victory came unto me;<br>
I kiss'd them languidly;<br>
And Virtue came, and Duty, stiff and holy;<br>
To these I said&mdash;Pray come another day;<br>
And turn'd away.<br>
<br>
Now since of all I am a little weary,<br>
And since on earth I must a while sojourn,<br>
And since a while must burn<br>
The censer of my long existence dreary,<br>
All things shall walk, that own my mastery,<br>
In luxury.<br>
<br>
My Ennui shall in vestments falling lowly,<br>
Stiff, purple, trailing, long, episcopal<br>
Sweep through her palace hall,<br>
Like to a consecrated bishop holy;<br>
My Sin from golden goblets of Byzant<br>
Shall drink absinthe.<br>
<br>
And my gold-crowned wanton goddess Pleasure,<br>
(My candles are all burning at her shrine)<br>
Shall be made drunk with wine,<br>
And walk unto the velvet-falling measure<br>
Of golden-voiced, solemn-sounding shawms.<br>
No rhyme for shawms.<br>
<br>
All they that wait upon me in my glory,<br>
My purple Pride, and my Luxuriousness,<br>
And my Voluptuousness,<br>
Shall show within their faces transitory<br>
Something more subtile than all life can give,<br>
While I shall live....<br>
<br>
Ah, all is liv'd, all eaten, all is drunken!<br>
Soul, is there anything now left for thee<br>
Excepting sanctity?<br>
<br>
Nay, ev'n we too have been in virtue sunken,<br>
We have been holy priest, we have confess'd,<br>
Said, <span style="font-style: normal;">Missa Est</span>.<br>
<br>
I have drunk out of heavy goblets golden,<br>
As from some hellish tabernaculum<br>
Cannabis, conium;<br>
I know quite all the poisons, all the olden<br>
Sins, all the ténébreux dark secrets hid,<br>
And things forbid.<br>
<br>
I have had all things unto mortals given,<br>
I all the women, all the passion I,<br>
All the satiety;<br>
I have had all the pleasures known in heaven,<br>
Paradisiacal, purpureal,<br>
Exstatical.<br>
<br>
With all the sciences I am acquainted,<br>
Alas! I know quite all the languages,<br>
All the philosophies,<br>
Alas! and all the pictures that are painted,<br>
And all the palac'd capitals that be<br>
Have wearied me.<br>
<br>
Alas, all art, all knowledge, and all passion<br>
I have had: I have heard all the symphonies;<br>
I have sail'd all the seas;<br>
I have drain'd all life's cup in languid fashion;<br>
And I am come to Persia again,<br>
Land of cocagne.<br>

<br>
<br>
In thy blue pallid gown that shimmereth<br>
So pale thou standest in the wan moonlight,<br>
Where the gold censer near thy body white<br>
Wraps thee around with its perfumed breath;<br>
<br>
So wan thy high tiara glimmereth<br>
Above thy mystical far eyes of light,<br>
Thou seemest some dead goddess of the night,<br>
O starry love, O changeless Ashtoreth.<br>
<br>
Pallid thou standest in thy divinity,<br>
Like some moon-idol of the buried time,<br>
Before whose face priests sing in solemn chime.<br>
<br>
So I prostrate before thy deity,<br>
Unto thy face have solemn praises sung,<br>
And in my hands a golden censer swung.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><a id="PARFAIT_AMOUR"></a>PARFAIT AMOUR</span><br>
<br>
<br>
It is not that thy face is fair<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As dying sunsets are,</span><br>
Nor that thy lovely eyelids wear<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The splendour of a star;</span><br>
Tis the deep sadness of thine eyes<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hath my heart captive led,</span><br>
And that within thy soul I prize<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The calmness of the dead.</span><br>
<br>
O holy love, O fair white face,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O sweet lost soul of thine!</span><br>
Thy bosom is an altar-place,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy kisses holy wine;</span><br>
Sweet incense offer'd for my bliss<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is thy corrupted breath,</span><br>
And on thy stained lips I kiss<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The holy lips of Death!</span><br>
<br>
Wherefore because thy heart is all<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fill'd full of mournfulness,</span><br>
And thy gold head as with a pall<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hung o'er with sinfulness;</span><br>
Because thy soul is utterly<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sinful unto the core&mdash;</span><br>
Therefore my heart is bound to thee,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dear love, forevermore!</span><br>

Naught is more sweet than gently to let dream<br>
The pallid flower of life asleep alway;<br>
Where the dim censer sends up far from day<br>
Unceasingly its still-ascending stream,<br>
<br>
O where the air winds its myrrh-scented steam<br>
About thy naked body's disarray,<br>
Shall not today's gold to thy shut eyes seem<br>
Born and forgot in the dead ages gray?<br>
<br>
Sunk from life's mournful loud processional,<br>
For thee shall not with high uplifted urn<br>
The Night pour out dreams that awake and say,<br>
<br>
&mdash;We were, O pallid maiden vesperal,<br>
Before the world; we also in our turn<br>
By the vain morning gold scatter'd away.<br>

I love all sombre and autumnal things,<br>
Regal and mournful and funereal,<br>
Things strange and curious and majestical,<br>
Whereto a solemn savor of death clings:<br>
<br>
Coerulian serpents mark'd with azure rings;<br>
Awful cathedrals where rich shadows fall;<br>
Hoarse symphonies sepulchral as a pall;<br>
Mad crimes adorn'd with bestial blazonings.<br>
<br>
Therefore I love thee more than aught that dies,<br>
Within whose subtile beauty slumbereth<br>
The twain solemnity of life and death;<br>
<br>
Therefore I sit beside thee far from day<br>
And look into thy holy eyes alway,<br>
Thy desolate eyes, thine unillumin'd eyes.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><a id="LANGUOR"></a>LANGUOR</span><br>

<br>
Although thy face be whiter than the dawn,<br>
Fairer than aught the dawning hath descried,<br>
Hast thou not now, O dear love deified,<br>
Enough of kisses upon thy forehead wan?<br>
<br>
The days and nights, like beads to pray upon,<br>
Pass by before our eyes and not abide,<br>
And so these things shall be till we have died,<br>
Until our bodies to the earth are gone.<br>
<br>
I think how pleasant such a thing must be,<br>
That all thy lovely limbs should fall away,<br>
And drop to nothing in their soft decay.<br>
<br>
Then may thy buried body turn to me,<br>
With new love on thy changed lips like fire,<br>
And kiss me with a kiss that shall not tire.<br>
<br>

I sat in tall Gomorrah on a day,<br>
Boring myself with solitude and dreams,<br>
When, like strange priests, with sacerdotal tread,<br>
The seven mortal sins, in rich array,<br>
<br>
Came in and knelt: one old, and weak, and gray,<br>
One that was shrouded like a person dead,<br>
And one whose robes cast reddish-purple gleams<br>
Upon her scornful face at peace alway.<br>
<br>
They swung before me amschirs of strange gold,<br>
And one most beautiful began to pray,<br>
Dreamily garmented in pallid blue.<br>
<br>
But I said only&mdash;I have dream'd of you.<br>
Naught really is; all things are very old,<br>
And very foolish. Please to go away.<br>

Tired Muse, put faded roses on thy brow,<br>
Put thy bare arms about the harp, and sing:<br>
&mdash;I am a little bor'd with everything.<br>
Past the clos'd jalousies the mlengkas go;<br>
<br>
They are not beautiful; no Greek they know;<br>
They go about and howl and make a fuss;<br>
I gaze through <i>sâd</i>-shap'd eyelids languorous,<br>
Far off from Ispahân where roses blow.<br>
<br>
Professors sit on lofty stools upcurl'd,<br>
Through Yankee noses drooling all day long;<br>
I find all these things quite ridiculous.<br>
<br>
Before despis'd old age comes over us,<br>
Let us step into the great world ere long.<br>
We shall be very grand in the great world!<br>

They come and go, they pass before my soul,<br>
Desire and Love, weak Anguish and Distress,<br>
Shame and Despair: in phantom crowds they press,<br>
Life's poor processional, Time's lowly dole.<br>
<br>
Mournful their voices as slow bells that toll,<br>
Voices of them that curse and do not bless;<br>
Ineffable things wrapp'd round with loathsomeness,<br>
The deeds that I have done in Fate's control.<br>
<br>
They leer and moan, they shriek and threat and lower,<br>
Ignoble faces that the sky do mar;<br>
My changeless soul from her high pride of power<br>
<br>
Looks down unmov'd. So the calm evening star<br>
Upon the wallowing peaceless sea looks down,<br>
Set far aloft within the heaven's crown.<br>

Quelle bêtise! O Muse, no longer lappt in sadness let us lie,<br>
Bring the jars of old Falernum, bring the roses ere they die!<br>
I love laughter, I love kisses, I love Lili, I love love,<br>
But these dingy funeral dirges ennuyer us by-and-by;<br>
Fellows, disinvoltamente, when the lords of life depart,<br>
Lift the wine-cup to your haughty lips, and sing, Good-bye, goodbye!<br>
We have laughter on our lips, and in our hearts the laughing spring,<br>
Nothing greatly can afflict us, nor our spirits mortify;<br>
All the laws and regulations under scornful feet we tread,<br>
We laugh loud at all the virtues underneath the shining sky;<br>
I have heard, when haughty Tarquin did his horrid deed of sin,<br>
That Lucretia's lily fingers slapp'd his face vivaciously;<br>
Though of all my life dear Lili make a gay dégringolade,<br>
Yet to my ennuis doth Lili sing an endless lullaby;<br>
We are Greeks and we are Tartars, we know all the languages,<br>
To the girls of Persia, India, China, we know how to sigh;<br>
If the heartless heart of Lili tediously cruel prove,<br>
Go and dance the tarantella with the girls of Hôkusai!<br>
In the golden-citied world from Paris unto Tokiô<br>
We are quite at home, we saunter languidly through tall Shanghai;<br>
Chairete! the shaw of rosy Persia is a gentleman,<br>
Charming people in Benares where the Ganges loiters by;<br>
Allah akbar! O great world, O golden-tower'd cities gay,<br>
Into all your gates with laughter and with roses enter I!<br>
<br>
Kalliste, your Persian ghazal cease to sing: the sun is low,<br>
And the sacred hour of absinthe now is very very nigh.<br>

With sweet life and sweet death for dower;<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pure golden kisses bought for gold;</span><br>
Each breast is like a golden bowl.<br>

These things are for a scorn to those<br>

That say, Joy dieth as the rose&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pleasures of the life in gray.</span><br>

&mdash;O Muse of mine that sittest orientally<br>
With a green emerald snake about the waist of thee,<br>
With henna-tinted feet, and almond eyes that dream,<br>
Put down the opium-pipe of jade and ivory,<br>
For she that is most fair is fain to hear thy song:<br>
Awake, O Muse, and sing her praises solemnly,<br>
That to the laughing heart of California<br>
Hath added all the grace of France and Italy;<br>
She who, to put to sleep my pitiless ennuis<br>
Is come from distant Paris and from Varsovie;<br>
Athens is in her heart, and Paris in her eyes,<br>
Dear European angel from beyond the sea!<br>
<br>
&mdash;There is no use to sing; she is not to be sung;<br>
What mortal praise can come unto her glory near?<br>
And she hath quite forgot her natal English tongue;<br>
She is too far, too high, thy languid praise to hear,<br>

&mdash;Why sittest thou, O Muse, in grief enfolden?<br>
&mdash;Thou hast me promis'd jewels rich and rare<br>
To wear within my hair;<br>
And for my slaves the kings of kingdoms olden;<br>
<br>
And to abide in lofty castles golden,<br>
Because I am most fair.<br>
And lo, I have no sandals for my feet,<br>
And little bread to eat.<br>
<br>
Of that far golden Irem I am dreaming,<br>
Whence for few kisses I did follow thee;<br>
Fair is that spot to see,<br>
<br>
With far-off waving palms and towers gleaming;<br>
Great deserts round that isle of blissful seeming<br>
Lie stretching endlessly.<br>

When I contemplate how my state is low,<br>
And how my pride that had the earth for throne<br>
In this dark city sitteth all alone,<br>
My heart is fain for death to end its woe;<br>
<br>
Then when I think how all the great below<br>
Had only sorrow and grief through all their days,<br>
I, that with these shall some time stand in place,<br>
My fortune like their bitter fortune know.<br>
<br>
Among whom also holy Baudelaire,<br>
Though unto him the loftiest lot was given<br>
To hear the blessed muses sing in heaven,<br>
<br>
Past his few days in anguish and despair;<br>
Yet did he not bow down his mournful head<br>
Until Peace found him in his glory dead.<br>
<br>
So thou in this low lair,<br>
Although in sorrow and grief thou dost remain,<br>
Though of all things whereof thy soul was fain<br>
Remaineth only pain,<br>
Yet be not thou, O soul, disconsolate:<br>
Forget not thou thy far-exalted state.<br>

Be not cast down my heart, and be not sad,<br>
That thou like common men must sorrow know;<br>
Not only they that live and die below,<br>
But ev'n the gods thy supreme sorrow had;<br>
<br>
Not unto Tammuz was this fortune given,<br>
Not to know grief; whom starry Ashtoreth<br>
Sought through the seven-gated realm of death,<br>
Far from the great moon and the stars of heaven.<br>
<br>
Osiris also could not but to die;<br>
He reigneth king among the perisht dead;<br>
And Christ, when his long grief was finished,<br>
<br>
Hid his great glory in the lowly ground.<br>
All these had sorrow, that were great and high;<br>
These also were august, these also crown'd.<br>

The lady rode 'neath the strange sky's pall<br>
Through the leafy woods funereal,<br>
And all the length of her moonlit way<br>
Was wanly white as the light of day;<br>
Solemnly rob'd she rode along,<br>
Unmindful of their droning throng<br>
That throng'd her shadowy path, alas,<br>
As though to see her funeral pass;<br>
So through the mournful forest slow<br>
Her palfrey's silken feet did go,<br>
Bearing her solemnly like a god<br>
Over the shadow-haunted sod;<br>
She laught to see the dead desire<br>
That even now her life should tire,<br>
She laught to think that to the earth<br>
They call'd her that was full of mirth,<br>
And though before her horse's head<br>
Throng'd the wan legions of the dead<br>
Wanly attempting to stop her way,<br>
She halted not for their legions gray,<br>
But rode through the midnight's mystic noon<br>
Under the far gaze of the moon.<br>
Then out from the dying woods at last<br>
Into the moonlit plain she passt;<br>
The misty stars were almost dead<br>
Sunk in the heavens overhead,<br>
While low down in the solemn skies<br>
The white moon wan'd as one that dies.<br>
Solemnly through the misty air<br>
She rode with gold gems in her hair;<br>
Bright were her holy eyes divine,<br>
And red her lips as the red red wine.<br>
At last in the unceasing night<br>
Down from her palfrey she doth alight<br>
By the strange murmuring of the sea;<br>
She climbs the tall stair fearlessly,<br>
And cometh at last to her chamber high<br>
Beneath the wide face of the sky.<br>
At last her journey being done,<br>
She hath her golden stays undone,<br>
And being a little wearied,<br>
Hath laid her naked on her bed,<br>
Thinking to slumber like the dead.<br>

In the dark bosom of the earth divine,<br>
Being turned unto a heap of ashes fine,<br>

Wave heavy hanging censers of delight,<br>
Give me an anodyne for my despair;<br>

O careless drunken heavy poppy-flowers,<br>
Make that the day for me be as the night.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Give me to lie down in your drowsy bowers,</span><br>
That having breathed of your rich perfume,<br>
My soul may have all-rest through all the hours;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So shall I lie within my little room,</span><br>

O yellow tawny fading blooms of gold,<br>
Give unto me your holy fruit to eat;<br>

Make me forget that dolorous vow that sears,<br>
Not to be lesser than the great of old;<br>

And all that lives from out the writhing past,<br>
Old struggles, dead ambitions, buried tears;<br>

&mdash;Sweet is forgetfulness, most sweet to lie,<br>
Sunken from sorrow, in our pleasant vale,<br>
Where but the sun shines, and the clouds go by;<br>

The toiling shore fades and becomes a sky,<br>
And evermore behind the billows fail.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweet to forget the death-like things that were,</span><br>
Green pastures where the clouds sail by on high,<br>
Dead sundawns over pathless prairies fair,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And suns long sunk beneath the wall of the sky.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under the sun my spirit lies alone,</span><br>
Drunken with slumber and mild exstasy....<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sleep, sweet sleep, long unto mine eyes unknown.</span><br>
Drops on me as ripe fruit drops from a tree;<br>
My dim eyes see the valley poppy-strown;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The clouds fade and the gold sun over me,</span><br>
And the world's murmur sounds within my lair<br>
Like the far tossing of some infinite sea;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within the heavy slumber-laden air</span><br>
All fades, all fades, and grows afar afar,<br>
Leaving my soul alone, empty of care,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Even as happy long-dead bodies are.</span><br>
Even so I slumber in my tireless close,<br>
While the whole world fades like a fading star,<br>

Lo, all the passionate pale evening<br>
I lay between the breasts of my beloved,<br>
Among the lilies, in the lily garden.<br>
The sky was pale, and all the sunset faded,<br>
And all the stars I saw not in the heaven,<br>
Because the glory of her face above me<br>
I saw alone, wrapt in a dream of slumber;<br>
And lo, she was more fair than all the lilies,<br>
Among the lilies, in the lily garden.<br>
And all her hair was golden chains to bind me,<br>
And all her mouth was crimson fire to burn me,<br>
And all the world became as wind before me,<br>
But as the wind before her face that passes,<br>
Among the lilies, in the lily garden.<br>
And lo, her face was fairer than the stars are,<br>
And lo, her breasts were whiter than the moon is,<br>
Whiter than the moon, and tipp'd with crimson coral.<br>
And low she bow'd her body, low before me,<br>
And gave me of her joy unto fulfilling:<br>
She bow'd her head whereto the stars do homage,<br>
Before whose face the years wax dim and fading,<br>
Before whose eyes the ages pass and vanish;<br>
Bow'd her low down before me like a lily,<br>
Among the lilies, in the lily garden.<br>
And now at last I care not if the morning<br>
Come at all, or the pale stars have setting,<br>
Nay I care not if the whole world perish,<br>
Perish and die, or if the white stars falter,<br>
Nay I care not if the night forever<br>
Hold me by her, and all things have ceasing;<br>
Yea, because her lips are more than roses,<br>
Yea, because her breasts are more than Heaven,<br>
Yea, because her face is more than God is,<br>

Now that the earth thy buried corpse doth hold,<br>
Now that thy soul that hath so much desired,<br>
Is gone down to the places of the tired,<br>
Far from the dawning and the star-light cold;<br>
<br>
Thine eyes shall not again the sun behold;<br>
Now shall thy body that all men hath fired<br>
Have ceasing, and thy grave shall be admired,<br>
That doth the fairest thing o' the earth enfold.<br>
<br>
Now that thine ashes are all buried,<br>
And thou art gone to slumber with the blessed,<br>
Thy buried body shall be no more distressed;<br>
<br>
Being now number'd with the placid dead,<br>
Thine eyes forever more have ceas'd from weeping,<br>
For evermore thy spirit shall have sleeping.<br>

Lo, how the moon, beloved,<br>
Far in the heavens gleaming,<br>
Over the ocean dreaming<br>
Her pallid light doth throw;<br>
<br>
Lo, where the endless ocean,<br>
Where softly the night wind bloweth,<br>
Into the darkness floweth,<br>
Thither at last I go.<br>
<br>
Listen, how sweet the ocean<br>
Unto our spirits sigheth,<br>
And lo, where our pinnace lieth<br>
Awaiting, with sails unfurl'd;<br>
<br>
Come thou with me, beloved,<br>
Come thou with heart unquailing,<br>
There where no ships come sailing,<br>
Out of the dreary world.<br>
<br>
Come thou with me, beloved,<br>
Out of the world and its seeming,<br>
Where all things are only dreaming,<br>
And shadows all we know;<br>
<br>
The heart hath not found its longing<br>
Here, nor shall find it ever;<br>
Behold of my life's endeavour<br>
Remaineth only woe.<br>
<br>
Behold, my desire, my anguish,<br>
Trouble and toil surpassing,<br>
Are all but as shadows passing,<br>
Shadows the fame thereof;<br>
<br>
Here, where the heart attaineth<br>
Not, what the heart desireth,<br>
Where beauty too early tireth,<br>
And kisses mean not love.<br>
<br>
Here where what man hath desired,<br>
He shall not find forever,<br>
But ever and only ever<br>
Unending vanity;<br>
<br>
Not in this world, beloved,<br>
My only longing hideth,<br>
But in farther lands abideth<br>
And over a wider sea.<br>
<br>
There, when the spring shall blossom,<br>
There, when the winter is vanisht,<br>
My spirit that long was banisht<br>
Shall come to its home, though late;<br>
<br>
There in mine olden kingdom,<br>
Where nothing is transitory,<br>
I in exceeding glory<br>
Shall hold mine ancient state.<br>
<br>
Here let us leave our anguish,<br>
Here at the hour of leaving,<br>
Leave we our woe and grieving<br>
Like garments long outworn;<br>
<br>
Leave we our mortal sorrow,<br>
Our longing and our repenting,<br>
The anguish and the lamenting<br>
That made our hearts to mourn.<br>
<br>
Others may weep and anguish,<br>
Others may talk of laughter,<br>
And ever a little after<br>
Sorrow is theirs the more;<br>
<br>
But we two have done with laughter<br>
And sadness that hath no reason,<br>
We two in the springtime season<br>
Push out from the weary shore.<br>
<br>
Past are the storms of winter,<br>
Past is the rainy weather,<br>
Past are the snows, together<br>
With sadness and sorrowing;<br>
<br>
Past are the rains, beloved,<br>
Past is the time of weeping,<br>
And lo, o'er the green earth sleeping,<br>
Laugheth the world-wide Spring!<br>
<br>
Come thou with me, beloved,<br>
O let us now be starting!<br>
All things, at the hour of parting,<br>
Shall be made new for thee;<br>
<br>
Listen, how sweet the ocean<br>
Unto our spirits calleth;<br>
Softly the starlight falleth<br>
Over the dreaming sea.<br>
<br>
Fadeth the land, beloved,<br>
That long hath our spirits tired,<br>
Before us lies that desired<br>
Far country, strange and new;<br>
<br>
Far off lies that dream'd-of country<br>
Eternally fair and blessed<br>
Eternally undistressed,<br>
Far over the ocean blue.<br>
<br>
Knowst thou the land, beloved?<br>
Year-long with gentle motion<br>
There the unending ocean<br>
Batheth the tropic shore;<br>
<br>
There never storms blow loudly,<br>
There never wet rain falleth,<br>
There never loud wind calleth,<br>
Nor stormy waters roar.<br>
<br>
Fairer the stars that lighten<br>
There, than to us is given,<br>
There in a fairer heaven<br>
Shineth a larger moon;<br>
<br>
Fair stand the castles golden<br>
There, and o'er stranger flowers<br>
There through the long long hours<br>
The wandering breezes swoon.<br>
<br>
There in that land, beloved,<br>
Is never a sound of living,<br>
Never is heard thanksgiving<br>
There, nor the noise of moan;<br>
<br>
There naught is heard of sorrow,<br>
And nothing is there begotten;<br>
There, with all life forgotten,<br>
We two shall come alone.<br>
<br>
There, O my one beloved,<br>
Through twilight never-closing,<br>
We two shall sit reposing,<br>
Forever, thou with me;<br>
<br>
There 'neath the stars eternal,<br>
We two shall sit, we only,<br>
While from the heavens, lonely,<br>
The moon sinks in the sea.<br>

Lo, in the night I cry out, in the night,<br>
God! and my voice shall howl into the sky!<br>
I am weary of seeing shapeless things that fly,<br>
And flap into my face in their vile flight;<br>
<br>
I am weary of dead things that crowd into my sight,<br>
I am weary of hearing horrible corpses that cry,<br>
God! I am weary of that lidless Eye<br>
That comes and stares at me, O God of light!<br>
<br>
All, all the world is become a dead blur,<br>
God! God! and I, stricken with hideous blight,<br>
Crouch in the black corners, and I dare not stir.<br>
<br>
I am aweary of my evil plight.<br>
If thou art not a dead corpse in thy sky,<br>
Send thou down Death into my loathed sty!<br>

Far in the melancholy hills it stands,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Far off; and through the vista of the years,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down which my soul its helpless journey steers,</span><br>
It flames a fire to lighten all the lands,<br>
A fire that burns me and a flame that brands<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Me, whose dead days pass slow as heavy tears.</span><br>
<br>
The road my footsteps tread is dim and still,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There darkness abides and silence endlessly,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the low way mine eyes can scarcely see;</span><br>
And yet the light and sound from that far hill<br>
Like the sky's fire my weary pathway fill,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So that it seems a place of life to be.</span><br>
<br>
The world is but a background for it there,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There where it stands, loud like a beaten lyre,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And flames blood-red like some vast funeral-pyre,</span><br>
Whereat my heart to fail doth not forbear;<br>
Of all the things that have been made soe'er<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Only the House remains, a quenchless fire.</span><br>
<br>
Ah God, that this thing were not in the world&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hateful House that flames with light and song</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And weary singing all the ages long;</span><br>
Ah that ev'n this might in the dust be hurl'd,<br>
And crush'd and slain, even as my heart, where curl'd<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The kindly armies of the worm do throng.</span><br>
<br>
Yea, surely I have seen it long ago,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Far sunken in the weary dust of time;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yea surely even that stair so hard to climb</span><br>
I climb'd, and strode its hallways to and fro;<br>
The which were bright with many lamps aglow,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And loud with choristers in ceaseless chime.</span><br>

Out of the grave, O God, I call to thee,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be thou not deaf unto my dolorous cry;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My soul is fallen down into the sty,</span><br>
And the dead things are crawling over me;<br>
O thou my God, give me the worm to flee,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out from the pit's depths I would rise on high.</span><br>
<br>
Again am I fallen down into the grave,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My soul is sunken in the place of slime,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am too weak its loathed walls to climb,</span><br>
Thou, only thou, O God, art strong to save;<br>
Lo, in mine eyes the worms have made their cave,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And squatting toads oppress me all the time.</span><br>
<br>
Yea, from this pit I have crawl'd out before;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With groans and cries and many a dolorous fall,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I have climbed up its impregnable wall;</span><br>
I shall not rise now from its slimy floor;<br>
O God, hear thou my lamentable call,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or from the grave I come not evermore.</span><br>
<br>
I am become a housing for the toad;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All things are fled wherein I took delight;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is no joy here, and there is no light;</span><br>
O God, O God, I have reap'd what I sow'd;<br>
I am become a dead thing in the night,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in my heart the worms have their abode.</span><br>
<br>
Lo, from my body all my might is fled,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all the light is gone out of mine eyes;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mine ears hear only lamentable cries,.</span><br>
And eyeless things stand round about my head;<br>
I am made as a man that slowly dies;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am made as a man already dead.</span><br>

Holy Pestilence, come on the cities, come and strike down,<br>

Thou shalt rejoice for woe:<br>
The pallid goblet old,<br>
That holds thy life's dull wine,<br>
Is made thereby divine;<br>
Stain'd with a purpler glow,<br>
And wrought in stranger gold.<br>
<br>
II<br>
<br>
From the suck'd lees of pain,<br>
We have won joy again:<br>
Death shall thee not distress:<br>
That sleepy bitterness<br>
To thy kist lips shall be<br>
The supreme exstasy.<br>

III<br>
<br>
Put ashes on your golden body bare,<br>
Puissant as musk, bitter-sweet as to die,<br>
Ashes upon your arms that grow not old,<br>
And on your unassuaged lips of gold:<br>
So we will wanton in love's sepulchre,<br>
And mock the face of Death with blasphemy.<br>
<br>
IV<br>
<br>
I love you more than Death: your mournful head,<br>
Your shrouding hair, and your unfathom'd eyes,<br>
And your white body beautiful, alas,<br>
Priestess and victim in love's holy mass....<br>
Your flesh that loves, and loving ever dies....<br>
I could not love you more if you were dead.<br>
<br>
V<br>
<br>
Death is death; the little host that squirms,<br>
The smell, the dark, the coffin clos'd, and I<br>
So soft, so soft; no movement, and no breath;<br>
No ears, no nose, no eyeballs; Death is Death;<br>
The sepulchre, no sight, no sound, no cry,<br>
And always; Death is Death; the worms! the worms<br>
<br>
VI<br>
<br>
Not for your evil is my spirit sad&mdash;<br>
I mourn because you are not really bad;<br>
Because your beauty's perfect cruelty<br>
Is ever marr'd with pity and distress,<br>
And you still show within your wickedness<br>
The poor stale weakness of humanity.<br>
<br>
VII<br>
<br>
I am as one that thirsteth for all things,<br>
As one that holdeth to his lips the cup,<br>
With lower'd eyes searching the wine's dull flame.<br>
No thing may I refuse among all things,<br>
Till, having drain'd unto its dregs the cup,<br>
I may return into the astral flame.<br>
<br>
VIII<br>
<br>
Heart, we have wholly drain'd the cup of sadness,<br>
And found in sadness no reality;<br>
Now from the night of sadness let us go.<br>
Henceforward let us drain the cup of gladness,<br>
And find in gladness no reality;<br>
From sadness then and gladness let us go.<br>

Its soft hand doth a golden sceptre hold;<br>
And in its flesh lie sleeping worms uproll'd.<br>
<br>
They that pass ceaseless by see not at all;<br>
They know not that beneath its garments' fold<br>
Is but a corpse, rotted, and dead, and tall.<br>
<br>
He is accurst that sees it dead and old;<br>
He is accurst that sees: the white worms call<br>
For him: for him have funeral dirges toll'd.<br>

<br>
They do not know that they are wholly dead,<br>
Nor that their bodies are to the worm given o'er<br>
They pass beneath the sky forevermore;<br>
With their dead flesh the earth is cumbered.<br>
<br>
Each day they drink of wine and eat of bread,<br>
And do the things that they have done before;<br>
And yet their hearts are rotten to the core,<br>
And from their eyes the light of life is fled.<br>
<br>
Surely the sun is weary of their breath;<br>
They have no ears, and they are dumb and blind;<br>
Long time their bodies hunger for the grave.<br>
<br>
How long, O God, shall these dead corpses rave?<br>
When shall the earth be clean of humankind?<br>
When shall the sky cease to behold this death?<br>

O endless idiocy of humankind!<br>
O blatant dead that howl and scream and roar!<br>
O strange dead things the worms have gambled for!<br>
O dull and senseless, foolish, mad and blind!<br>
<br>
How long now shall your scent defile the wind?<br>
How long shall you make vile the earth's wide floor?<br>
How long, how long, O waiting ages hoar,<br>
Shall the white dawn their gaping faces find?<br>
<br>
O vile and simple, blind of heart and mind,<br>
When shall your last wave roll forevermore<br>
Back from the sick and long-defiled shore?<br>
<br>
When shall the grave the last dead carcass bind?<br>
O shameless humankind! O dead! O dead!<br>
When shall your rottenness be buried?<br>

I<br>
<br>
I saw a dead corpse lying in a tomb,<br>
Long buried and rotten to the core;<br>
Behold this corpse shall know not evermore<br>
Aught that may be outside its wormy room;<br>
<br>
It lies uncover'd in the pesty gloom,<br>
Eyeless and earless, on the charnel-floor,<br>
While in its nameless corpse the wormlets hoar<br>
Make in its suppurated brain their room.<br>
<br>
And in that charnel that no lights illume,<br>
It shriek'd of things that lay outside its door;<br>
And while the still worms through its soft heart bore,<br>
<br>
It lay and reason'd of the ways of doom,<br>
And in its head thoughts mov'd as in a womb;<br>
And in its heart the worms lie evermore.<br>
<br>
II<br>
<br>
I saw a dead corpse in a haughty car,<br>
Whom in a high tomb phantom horses bore,<br>
Aye to and fro upon the scatter'd floor;<br>
His dead eyes star'd as though they look'd afar,<br>
<br>
His gold wheels myriad perish'd souls did mar,<br>
While through his flesh the ravenous wormlets tore;<br>
He in whose eyes the worm was conqueror,<br>
Held his high head unmoved like a star.<br>
<br>
And as with loud sound and reverberant jar,<br>
And as with splash of crusht flesh and dull roar,<br>
The death-car thunder'd past the tomb-walls hoar,<br>
<br>
Within those dead dominions the dead tsar<br>
Receiv'd his plaudits where dead bodies are;<br>
And in his heart the worms lie evermore.<br>
<br>
III<br>
<br>
I saw a dead corpse making a strange cry,<br>
With dead feet planted on a high tomb's floor;<br>
The dead stand round, with faces that implore;<br>
His dead hands bless them, stretched forth on high.<br>
<br>
&mdash;And art thou God?&mdash;and art thou majesty?&mdash;<br>
And art thou he whom all the dead adore?&mdash;<br>
And art thou he that hath the skies in store?&mdash;<br>
Nay, nay, dead dust, dead dust, and vanity.<br>
<br>
And wouldst thou rise up to the lighted sky?&mdash;<br>
Nay, nay, thy limbs are rotten on the floor;<br>
Thou shalt not out from thy polluted sty;<br>
<br>
Thou wouldst become divinity once more,<br>
Thou dreamest of splendour that shall never die<br>
And in thy heart the worms lie evermore.<br>
<br>
IV<br>
<br>
I saw a dead corpse lying on the floor<br>
Of a tomb; worms were in its woman's head,<br>
Its black flesh lay about it shred on shred,<br>
And the dead things slept in its bosom hoar.<br>
<br>
And evermore inside that loathed door,<br>
It turn'd itself as one upon a bed,<br>
It turn'd itself as one whom sleep hath fled,<br>
As one that the sweet pangs of passion bore.<br>
<br>
And from its passionate mouth's corrupted sore,<br>
And from its lips that are no longer red,<br>
Came forth love's accents; and it spake, and said.<br>
<br>
&mdash;The Pleiades and night's noon-hours are o'er,<br>
And I am left alone in wearyhead.<br>
And in its heart the worms lie evermore.<br>

<br>
1st Corpse.<br>
<br>
I would now that the sweet light of the sun<br>
Might once again shine down upon my face;<br>
So weary am I of my rottenness.<br>
<br>
2nd Corpse.<br>
<br>
Rejoice that now at least thou art done with life;<br>
This thing shall nevermore return.<br>
<br>
1st Corpse.<br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">At last</span><br>
My body is aweary of the tomb;<br>
It is a hundred years since in the grave<br>
I have lain down between four narrow walls,<br>
Shut up with putrid darkness and the worm.<br>
There is no flesh upon my body now,<br>
That was so long a-rotting; on my shelf<br>
Here am I now nothing but stinking bones,<br>
That have had life beneath the face of the sun.<br>
<br>
3rd Corpse.<br>
<br>
<i>I</i> am not yet utterly putrified,<br>
And the worms yet within my flesh abound;<br>
I do repent me that I did not learn<br>
What life was, while I liv'd beneath the sun&mdash;<br>
At least then I might think of what I had done;<br>
But I am rotten, and I have not liv'd.<br>
<br>
1st Corpse.<br>
<br>
I would that I might leave this place of ordure<br>
And look once more upon the face of the world,<br>
Where the sun is.<br>
<br>
2nd Corpse.<br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">O foolish ragged-bones,</span><br>
Wouldst thou show forth thy dripping excrements,<br>
And shredded rottenness to the face of day?&mdash;<br>
Stink and be still, and leave us here in peace.<br>
<br>
1st Corpse.<br>
<br>
Envy me not, O stench, slop-face, dung-eyes;<br>
My bones are clean and dry as the tomb's walls,<br>
And stink not; as for thee, thou art a sink.<br>
<br>
2nd Corpse.<br>
<br>
Envy me not, thou, that I am so sweet<br>
The black worms love me; hungry were that worm<br>
That on thee preys.<br>
<br>
4th Corpse.<br>
<br>
Be silent, both ye dead and rotten things;<br>
Lo I, that was unburied yesterday,<br>
Am fair and smooth and firm, and almost sweet;<br>
If that I were not dead, one might me love.<br>
<br>
3rd Corpse.<br>
<br>
Is it so sweet a thing, this love, this love?<br>
<br>
2nd Corpse.<br>
<br>
Thy lips are green for kissing, and streaks of black<br>
Streak over thee where the worms have not yet been!<br>
<br>
4th Corpse.<br>
<br>
Ha, ha, I know wherefore thou speakest so:<br>
Because thy torture is too great for thee,<br>
And the worms' gnawing, and thy body's rottenness,<br>
And the rottenness in thy bones and in thy brain!<br>
<br>
1st Corpse.<br>
<br>
O beautiful, O dead, O spit upon,<br>
He speaketh well that is but lately dead;<br>
Thy flesh lies all along thee like green slime,<br>
O pudding gravied in thine own dead sauce!<br>
<br>
2nd Corpse.<br>
<br>
Rotten one!<br>
<br>
1st Corpse.<br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Dung-heap!</span><br>

2nd Corpse.<br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">Dead one!</span><br>
<br>
1st Corpse.<br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 16.5em;">Beast! beast! beast!</span><br>
<i>Therefore</i> perhaps, thou art so early dead?<br>
<br>
2nd Corpse.<br>
<br>
They say that those thou lovedst were not men,<br>
O goat-face&mdash;Shall I say what was thy death?<br>
<br>
4th Corpse.<br>
<br>
Come, come, my brothers, be not so slanderous;<br>
We have all been the same upon the earth.<br>
<br>
3rd Corpse.<br>
<br>
Thou sayest true, new brother.<br>
<br>
1st Corpse.<br>
<br>
Thou sayest true.<br>
<br>
2nd Corpse.<br>
<br>
I shall not suffer anything any more;<br>
(Aside.) I have left all that; I am evermore releas'd;<br>
I shall not struggle and suffer any more;<br>
This seemeth strange and very sweet to me;<br>
And I shall grow accustom'd to the worms.<br>
<br>
5th Corpse.<br>
<br>
Rejoice not thou, that thou art fallen<br>
Into a pit where people leave their dung;<br>
There is no reason here for any joy.<br>
<br>
Sepulchre.<br>
<br>
Be silent, now, ye spindle-shankèd dead!<br>
Ye will learn to be silent when y'are here<br>
For a long time; ye always spout and roar,<br>
At first, before the time of rottenness;<br>
But so I suppose it must be,&mdash;y'are not the first,<br>
And ye shall not be the last; so fast i' the world,<br>
So eagerly they are begotten, and they die,<br>
And they are begotten again; just for this end<br>
Hideously propagated evermore.<br>
<br>
A Voice above singing.<br>
<br>
Golden is the sunlight,<br>
When the daylight closes,<br>
Golden blow the roses<br>
Ere the spring is old;<br>
All thy hair is golden,<br>
Falling long and lowly<br>
Round thy bosom holy;<br>
And thy heart is of fine gold!<br>

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><a id="FRAGMENTS"></a>FRAGMENTS</span><br>
<br>
I<br>
<br>
And since I understood not what so strong<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Driveth all these at such exstatic pace,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I too went down and joined in the throng;</span><br>
And many sitting in a lowly place<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I saw, where sense and vision darkness clogs,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With one flat-breasted wife with munched face</span><br>
And bestial litter as of rats or hogs;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These are all they that eat and multiply</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the same manner with low apes and dogs;</span><br>
Like these they live and like these they shall die.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&mdash;Pass thou from these, said then to me that voice,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And heed not thou the stinking of that sty.</span><br>
Then saw I them that did with wine rejoice,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crowning their heads with roses of the earth;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I too sat down and joined in that noise,</span><br>
But ask'd me soon&mdash;Why do all these have mirth?<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From these I past, weary of myrrh and wine.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Others apart whose spirits had more dearth</span><br>
Sat solitary as who would fain divine,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of seeing and of hearing ill content;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With these I sat, half drunken with the vine,</span><br>
And sick of visions that aye came and went;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But all the knowledge that their striving found</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was but one vision more than wine had sent;</span><br>
All these also shall moulder in the ground.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From these I past as from dead flesh and bones.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then came I where the kings of earth sat crown'd</span><br>
Neath purple canopies on golden thrones;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These offer'd me part in that changeless state,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until my soul wearied of brass and bronze.</span><br>
Others whose sweating nothing could abate<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kingdoms and cities build and overthrow,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till my soul wonder'd at the striving great</span><br>
Of all the puppets in that puppet-show:<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&mdash;Doth the string move them with such urgency,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That all their limbs such strange grimaces show?</span><br>
&mdash;These are all they that do, one made reply;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In all their actions never could I find</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What they were doing these things for nor why.</span><br>
From these I past as from the deaf and blind,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ever as I went the solemn brawl</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of all these mad and idiot howl'd behind.</span><br>
I came to those that ceased not to call.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The world unto them, shouting o'er and o'er:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My heart knew not why these so loudly bawl;</span><br>
And some stood round with faces that implore,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Asking for peace; and ever those that gave</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did but like these delude themselves the more;</span><br>
But rottenness shall stop all these that rave.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Last, some there were that did with vanity</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Toil ever with unwearied hands to save</span><br>
And to eternize all things great and high;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With these I stay'd, till my heart questioned:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&mdash;What are the things thou doëst here and why?</span><br>
Whereat all these became as persons dead.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then I arose from among these the last,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And follow'd then where'er my footsteps led;</span><br>
And among them that reigned then I past,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And among them that ever fain would know,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And among them whose lot with wine was cast;</span><br>
I past the prophets and the puppet-show,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And among them that joy'd in marble and in song,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all that Seven tir'd of long ago.</span><br>
And is this all the meaning of that throng,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This all, O heart, that wast of seeing fain,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But like a circle that still seemeth long</span><br>
Because it goeth round and round again?<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not in all these doth any reason hide</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No more than in the words of the insane.</span><br>
There is no ground for sorrow; nor in pride<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For pride; nor in them that in gladness sate;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wherefore with none of these shall I abide.</span><br>
The sought is vanity; the seeking great<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vanity; the not-seeking vanity;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For none of these change I my solemn state.</span><br>
<br>
II<br>
<br>
Then since no one could answer unto me<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The question, and since no one could me tell</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wherefore of this endless Vanity</span><br>
Of all the spirits that on earth did dwell,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I said&mdash;I go unto the Absolute;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He will perchance release me from this hell.</span><br>
Him that made noisy what before was mute<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I found upon a heap of filthy dung</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Low-sitting in the fashion of the brute.</span><br>
In strange grimaces still his face he wrung,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up to the chin within that filth immerst,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which still his busy hands about him flung.</span><br>
&mdash;Do thou those clothes wherein he is inhearst<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Take off, said I to one, and do not shirk.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He did, while still that being howl'd and curst,</span><br>
For there so thick and muddy was the murk,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he still bore of clothes so thick a weight,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I knew not well what thing therein did lurk.</span><br>
Three coverings then that one removed straight&mdash;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Omniscience, Omnipresence, Omnipotence,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From off the thing that in the ordure sate.</span><br>
Then did his truth show clear to every sense,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A filthy idiot so foul and low,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That decency the perfect tale prevents.</span><br>
And I&mdash;O thou whose nakedness doth show<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like one not in the womb to fulness brought,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why are all things that are; if thou dost know?</span><br>
Then he replied from out the ordure hot:<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&mdash;Brahma, great Brahma, Everlasting, I!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I&mdash;Not such reply my question sought.</span><br>
Answer thou me! And he still made reply:<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&mdash;Brahma, great Brahma! repetition vain.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I asked again: and&mdash;Brahma! he did cry.</span><br>
Then one thereby to me&mdash;Why art thou fain<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Knowledge to have from It? It knows not, It;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why seek for truth among the low insane?</span><br>
Then he that did within the ordure sit<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of the filth that lay about his feet</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such things as children make with little wit</span><br>
Made, and then broke, and did the act repeat.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&mdash;I have made all the worlds, he gibbered;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I his labour with these words did greet.</span><br>
&mdash;Why dost thou these things? why, O why? I said.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No word vouchsaf'd the mouth of him that stank,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But giggling sounds and idiot uttered.</span><br>
Then seated in that place of ordure rank,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With his two lips he made a cackling sound,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And back within the friendly ordure sank.</span><br>
Then I with a great sad and awful voice<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cried out&mdash;O thou that rottest in this sty,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O thou whose soul in ordure doth rejoice,</span><br>
What art thou doing these things for and why?<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then one to me&mdash;His bliss is not to know</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The infiniteness of his own Vanity;</span><br>
Therefore the soul of him that stinketh so,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because his sense is blind and deaf and mad</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forever, knoweth not eternal woe.</span><br>
Lo from the first his soul no reason had;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He thinketh he himself is everything,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And nothing is but him! He is not sad.</span><br>
Ignorance, ignorance, shrouds him like a pall;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therefore thus low upon the fetid floor</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He sits, and knoweth naught outside his stall.</span><br>
And I&mdash;He maketh naught outside his store.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why doth he this? and in this fetid tomb</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sitteth he here in madness evermore?</span><br>
How long shall iron, awful, gnashing doom<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leave him thus naked old and idiot</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blind deaf and stinking, in the loathed gloom</span><br>
How long shall This within the ordure squat?<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How long shall This cease not to beck and nod</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How long shall This cease not to rot and rot?</span><br>
And he&mdash;This rottenness that seemeth God<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More woe than this nor any other mode</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall know not, till It ceaseth in the sod.</span><br>
And as a gnat, a viper, or a toad,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because its nature is not infinite,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It too shall perish in the worm's abode;</span><br>
Till then It suppurateth in the night.<br>
<br>
III<br>
<br>
Then from the world I turn'd my steps afar;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I came there where the holy Trinity</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all the blessed saints in glory are,</span><br>
And did the beatific vision see,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And how those happy are that once did mourn;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But my heart said&mdash;All this is naught to me;</span><br>
Nor knew I why all these should be reborn.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where moon-fac'd houris wanton arms do fling</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Round Mahmud's blessed, I past by in scorn,</span><br>
For my heart dream'd a deeper revelling.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then came I to that banquet more divine</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Jayadeva and that Jami sing;</span><br>
And the fair goblet fill'd full of the wine<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brought the cup-bearer clad with wantonness;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there with the beloved and the vine</span><br>
My heart grew weary of that blessedness.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From life I past, finding no joy therein.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The vision and the vine and drunkenness</span><br>
Still like a circle ever closing in.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then I departed to the final peace,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sick of what is and shall be and hath been,</span><br>
Of Brahma, as the drop sinks in the seas:<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I past out from the bonds of thee-and-me,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lost in that Infinite whose being is</span><br>
Glory in all things and reality;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But therein I that was not I, alas</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In that deliverance from me-and-thee</span><br>
Where all illusion fadeth like to grass,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Found naught that equall'd my undimm'd desire;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&mdash;If that reality then real was,</span><br>
What is that real more than trodden mire?<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then from all being did my spirit pass,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sick of all being whether low or higher.</span><br>
Out of that circle unto nothingness<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I came, unto Nirvana, the far goal</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of many a holy saint, where visions cease;</span><br>
But nothingness did not my heart console.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah not in nothingness is any peace,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor in peace any peace, nor in the whole,</span><br>
Nor in the vine nor in the vision, nor<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In being nor non-being, nor in all</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That man hath dream'd of and hath anguisht for.</span><br>
Nay not in joy nor the vine jovial,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor in the perfume of the lov'd one's breath,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nay nor in anything anywhere at all;</span><br>
Nor in illusion; nor what sundereth<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Illusion; in the sundering of that chain</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is no joy; and not alas in death</span><br>
Find I that thing whereof my soul is fain.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All these things also are all vanity</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No less than sun and stars that wax and wane</span><br>
Forever in the everlasting sky.<br>

<br>
Now I am come to the nadir at last, to the absolute sorrow,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now all the stars are gone out of my sky;</span><br>
Night everlasting is mine without hope or desire of the morrow,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All my life's hopes are gone tombwards to die.</span><br>
All my life's glories lie perisht around me; and lo with great laughing<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Laugh I out loud, and I care not at all;</span><br>
Here with mine Anguish, my Sorrow, my Madness, my Grief, I sit quaffing<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wine, in high state in my echoing hall.</span><br>
This is the last night I drink with you, maniac wassailers dreary!<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lift up your goblets and drink ere I go!</span><br>
Lo, I am easily bor'd, I am easily tired and made weary;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now at the last I am weary of Woe.</span><br>
Lo, I that walk in the flower crown'd season of youthfulness golden,<br>
Think ye that all things my gladness can slay?<br>
Sorrow is fitting for dotards and them that are loathsome and olden;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>I</i> am as one that goes ever away.</span><br>
Lo, I laugh out at Grief, lo, I laugh in unending rejoicing,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I that have nightshade entwin'd in my hair;</span><br>
Heart of me, what dost thou here in the wearisome darkness, revoicing<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yesterday's stale and forgotten despair?</span><br>
Now it is midnight; but soon shall the wakening glory of morning<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shine in the East, when the darkness is gone;</span><br>
Now in my spirit that sat for a time in the darkness of mourning<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Waketh in gladness the mystical dawn.</span><br>
New spring laugheth without&mdash;to thy heart it is calling! and o'er thee<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soon shall the banners of dawn be unfurl'd;</span><br>
Wait thou no longer, O heart, O heart that art strong, for before thee<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lieth the pomp of the great high world!</span><br>
Now it is midnight; my Anguish, my Mourning, my Sadness, my Sorrow,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crown you with nightshade, and once more with me</span><br>
Drink and make merry; farewell! I am here with you now; on the morrow<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sail I over the mighty sea.</span><br>

<br>
<br>
Now at the last, Zulaikha, all my sorrows olden<br>
Are farther off than Europe or than China seem,<br>
And like an idle dream<br>
The North is faded far off in the distance golden;<br>
And here with thee I sit in perfect peace enfolden<br>
Beside the Ganges-stream.<br>
<br>
Full well I knew that ne'er those northern promontories<br>
Could give to me the dream that did my soul desire;<br>
For there my heart did tire;<br>
For always me allur'd the strangely whisper'd stories<br>
Of skies that burn with more consuming languid glories,<br>
And suns of mightier fire.<br>
<br>
I dream'd of heavier suns than burn in skies of ours,<br>
And heavier airs that through the long long evening swoon<br>
Under a larger moon,<br>
And heavier-scented gardens fill'd with stranger flowers,<br>
And tropic palms that wave through all the long long hours<br>
Of endless afternoon.<br>
<br>
At last now from that northern dream am I awoken,<br>
At last I am come home over the watery main;<br>
Long long I sigh'd in vain;<br>
Now under tropic palms I lie in peace unbroken,<br>
And mine own land I see, beloved, and hear spoken<br>
My natal tongue again.<br>
<br>
Zulaikha, past is all the longing and endeavour;<br>
The palm-trees sleep, and sleeping move not any leaf;<br>
Perisht is woe and grief;<br>
Stilly the padmas float upon the holy river;<br>
Among all these we two with languid eyes forever<br>
Lie sunk in endless kief.<br>
<br>
Before us riseth white our marble-builded palace;<br>
Thou hast let fall from out thy hands that weary are<br>
The volume of Attár.<br>
Thy hand hath spill'd the wine within the silver chalice;<br>
Upon the river winding through the distant valleys<br>
Sleepeth the nénufar.<br>
<br>
From out the oleanders languid slumber steepeth,<br>
And thou, Zulaihka, dost, in rest too deep for dream,<br>
Like one enchanted seem;<br>
Thy beauty now in waking slumber sunken sleepeth,<br>
And dreaming past thy wholly closed eyelids creepeth<br>
The sleepy-flowing stream.<br>
<br>
Thou hast the light of Asia in thy face divinest,<br>
And in thy scented mouth and in thy lotus-eyes,<br>
O wine of Paradise!<br>
O moon-fac'd love that by the sacred stream reclinest,<br>
Hath this world anything for which in vain thou pinest?<br>
That thing shall be thy prize.<br>
<br>
The caravans that in the desert, heavy-laden,<br>
By unknown oases pitch their sun-blacken'd tents,<br>
Shall bring thee all sweet scents<br>
Wherein delight in heaven the houris ever-maiden&mdash;<br>
Patchouli, nard, and myrrh, from many a distant aden<br>
Of heavenly indolence.<br>
<br>
All kinds of gems wherefore thine almond eyes have yearning,<br>
In heaps, wherein to bathe thy beauties languorous,<br>
O maiden amorous,<br>
They shall bring home to thee from distant isles returning&mdash;<br>
Pearl, sapphire, diamond, topaz, and ruby burning,<br>
And opal luminous.<br>
<br>
Thou art that sweet whereof all poets dead have chaunted,<br>
Therefore my soul hath sought thy face o'er pathless seas,<br>
Here to have endless peace;<br>
Thou art the garden of delight with slumber haunted,<br>
Thy perfume maketh dream of desert lands enchaunted,<br>
And far-off oases.<br>
<br>
Thou hast that beauty in thine all-consuming glances<br>
That openeth the ways to far enchanted skies,<br>
And in thy lotus-eyes<br>
Thou hast the light that shineth in the countenances<br>
Of them whose eyes have seen the glory which entrances<br>
The blest of Paradise.<br>
<br>
Thou art all sweets that unto perfect joy devote us,<br>
In thee all spices and all scents together come,<br>
O lute that now art dumb!<br>
Thou art musk, frankincense, amomum, stephanotis,<br>
Thou art the fragrant wine, the paradisal lotus,<br>
Thou art the opium.<br>
<br>
Hashsheesh nor opium are worth not thy caresses,<br>
Sweeter than opium to still the spirit's drouth<br>
Thine unassuaged mouth;<br>
Him that hath known thy love no mortal grief distresses;<br>
Sweeter thy kisses are than incense which oppresses<br>
The breezes of the South....<br>
<br>
At last I am come home, come home; and all regretting<br>
Is with the North afar from thee and me away.<br>
Behold O love, the day<br>
Is past, in Indian skies the holy sun is setting;<br>
The mûzin from his tower calleth unforgetting,<br>
The faithful ones to pray.<br>
<br>
Under the velvet night wide India reposes<br>
Now in the scented dark the champak odours swoon;<br>
Slowly the summer moon<br>
Riseth into the azure night made drunk with roses;<br>
And lo the camel-bells, now that the daylight closes,<br>
Tinkle their quiet tune.<br>
<br>
Behold, O well-beloved, 'neath the moonlight gleaming<br>
The travellers depart from out the sleeping khan,<br>
O perfume Asian!<br>
And past the moonlit palace, where we two lie dreaming,<br>
With camels and with horsemen like to shadows seeming<br>
Departs the caravan.<br>
<br>
It is the starting hour, O most melancholy!<br>
In long procession underneath the moon's pale gleams,<br>
Like something that but seems,<br>
The caravan departeth to the desert slowly,<br>
There far afar to seek through endless time the holy<br>
Mirages of their dreams.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><a id="DEDICATION"></a>DEDICATION</span><br>
<br>
<br>
These paltry rhymes, which loftier shall pursue<br>
Than aught America of high or great<br>
Hath seen since first began her world-wide state,<br>
I dedicate, my brother, unto you.<br>
